# CorsiGame

## Description

A computerized version of the Corsi test, created for my CS3160 final project.

The Corsi task is a game designed to measure a person's short-term memory. 


It consists of several rectangles placed in random locations on the screen which light up, one at a time, in a pattern.
The goal is to remember the sequence and click the blocks in the correct order.
A player's score is the longest sequence that they can remember and correctly repeat.

## Features
- Player profiles with scorekeeping

- Pattern generation
